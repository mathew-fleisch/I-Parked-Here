# I-Parked-Here
Saves a "dropped pin" on a google maps api as a text file and uses coordinates to place an icon, onLoad.

To Do:
  - Save json file instead of text file and update parser.
  - Make output responsive
  - Set up config file (boundries, center point, zoom level, house)
     - Create wizard when no config file is found to set the values in a UI
  - Verify relative and absolute paths
